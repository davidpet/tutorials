- Live Demo: https://davidpet.github.io/tutorials/jsgame/
  - GitHub pages for Tutorials repo set to use MASTER branch and docs/ folder
- To install: `npm install`
- To run: `npm run start`
  - will run from `index.html` and `dist/` folder (built automatically)
- To build `npm run build` and look for `package.zip`
- To deploy to the github docs folder for hosting: `npm run deploy`
  - you have to have done `npm run build` first
  - it will clear away the whole target folder and recopy the artifacts
  - you then have to go make a commit in Git to update the copy that is hosted
- To clean the `dist/` folder: `npm run clean`
- If you deploy and commit, but the JS changes don't show up, you need to do a **Hard Refresh**
  - In Chrome, load chrome devtools
  - just having devtools open unlocks a right-click menu for the refresh button that isn't normally there
- If you clone this project and make a different version of it, you will need to change the stuff above `scripts` in `package.json`.
- Explorations of future things to add with ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com/share/657ae2b7-fa07-49f5-b698-5490945b5997 and https://chat.openai.com/share/96deaa10-e077-4385-b20f-aa8bec6a4304
- Possible enhancements:
  - the phase is messed up when you reverse the direction by clicking - need to calculate a cumulative phase shift to sell the illusion
  - it'd be nice to have it pause when the window is invisible (use visibilitychange event and cancelAnimationFrame)
  - custom cursor by drawing image with transparency on pointermove (remove on pointerenter and pointerleave)
  - background sound and click shockwave sound effects using Audio object
