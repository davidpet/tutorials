# Parts of this Tutorial

- [WORKSPACE](WORKSPACE) - just there to make this folder into a bazel workspace.
- [BUILD](BUILD) - comments describe some high-level concepts like `bazel clean` and `bazel-bin`, etc.
- [subpackage](subpackage) - basics of filegroup and genrule targets, and globbing
- [pypackage](pypackage) - basics of libraries, binaries, srcs, data, deps, and runfiles. Python is used as the example, but the concepts are widely applicable.

# bazel-bin

I purposely left bazel-bin in git because the structure demonstrates the concepts in the comments of the targets.
However, at the time I didn't realize it was a symbolic link and thus doesn't show anything useful.

# TODO

-       proto_library (dependencies, protoc, cwd)
-       what repos archives, and calls in WORKSPACE actually do underneath
