# bazel-bin

I purposely left bazel-bin in git because the structure demonstrates the concepts in the comments of the targets.
However, at the time I didn't realize it was a symbolic link and thus doesn't show anything useful.

# TODO

-       glob in-depth
-       proto_library (dependencies, protoc, cwd)
-       what repos archives, and calls in WORKSPACE actually do underneath
